    <h3>Favorite Character: Tony Stark</h3>
</p>

<p>
    <h4>What makes it such a good movie? </h4>
</p>

<p>The characters are able to defeat the villian as a giant team and come together to complete a common goal. I love teamsports so the parallels during the movies final scenes with the giant battle involve strategy and teamwork.</p>
